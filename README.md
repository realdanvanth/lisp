# Telos
# A Tiny Language Built on Strings

**Telos** is a minimal interpreter dia-lect where **everything is an atom** and **everything evaluates to a string**.

At its core:
- Atoms are composed of **tuples** with two strings, where the first element is for variable declaration , N for no variables
and the second element is function code or subatom that must be evaluated.
- Subsequent elements are **arguments** â€” either sub atoms or user defined or inbuilt functions.
- All values are represented as **strings** internally and externally.
- Arithmetic, logic, and other operations **parse and return updated strings**.

---

## Philosophy
- **Code is data, and data is string.**
- Instead of traditional typed values, everything is stored and manipulated as a **string**.
- Atoms are the primary unit: a symbol that triggers evaluation.
- Evaluation always resolves to a **string result**, even for numbers or booleans.

## Examples
- ``("N ; print 'hello'")`` prints hello.
- ``("x=(x=5;print x);print x")`` prints 5
- ``("x=3;add x (N;add '1' '1')")`` outputs 5
- ``("N;if (N;greater '3' '2') (N;add '4' '1') (N;sub '5' '1')") ``outputs 5

### for loop possible syntax:
  ("x=(x=0; while (lt x 5) (x=add x 1; print x))")
